    "### Breast Cancer Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores three classic supervised learning algorithms—**K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Tree**—to classify breast cancer data from the Scikit-Learn library. We'll walk through preprocessing, training, evaluating, and comparing the models, with a focus on model performance and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a clear view of how each algorithm handles this biomedical classification task, and what trade-offs exist when choosing between them."
